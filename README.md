# UAV-UCAV-Projects
Merging all UAV-UCAV proejcts in one repository.

# Lock and Track the Competitor Devices
One of these projects contain the codes for locking on a target which is another UAV in the sky. 
Another one is about trajectory tracking in line with the task given in the competition during the flight of our UAV-UCAV teams. 

The codes include; giving commands to our plane such as arm, disarm, set; and using frames such as LocationGlobalRelative. 

the plane was attached to MissionPlanner and the simulations were done from there. 
Accordingly, the codes are; after the configuration of the aircraft was done in MP, it was run.
According to the commands given in the code, the plane could take off,
land at the determined coordinates and stay in the air at the parameters we wanted.

# Object Detection
We've worked with YOLOv3 algorithm techniques to create our model, process the images, 
tracking the trajectory in line with the coordinates given in the competition directive. 

# Servo Motor Controlling
Due to our tasks, We needed to control 
the 5 servo motors to maneuver the UAV and to orient the UAV to the detected object. 

And as you see codes, servo motors have to connect with camera to sense the movement and orient the UAV. 
So, here are 3 projects about connection between servo motors-camera, object detection-orientation and acted autonomous with these tasks.
